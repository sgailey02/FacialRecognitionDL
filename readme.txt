Image Capture is a tool used to create the ~600 photos needed for the training process
It will create the folders needed to run when ran and open a webcam box for you to use as a reference
Holding A will take the anchor photos and holding V will take the verification photos.
The A photos take a shorter time to take than the V photos.
